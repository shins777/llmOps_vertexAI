    "  You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by AI models.\n",
    "  We will provide you with the user input and an AI-generated responses.\n",
    "  You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\n",
    "  You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Evaluation\n",
    "  ## Metric Definition\n",
    "  You will be assessing fluency, which measures language mastery of the model's response based on the user prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Criteria\n",
    "  Fluency: The text is free of grammatical errors, employs varied sentence structures, and maintains a consistent tone and style, resulting in a smooth and natural flow that is easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Rating Rubric\n",
    "  5: (Completely fluent). The response is free of grammatical errors, demonstrates nuanced word choice, and has a natural, seamless flow.\n",
    "  4: (Mostly fluent). The response has very few, if any, minor grammatical errors. Word choice is clear, and sentences generally flow well.\n",
    "  3: (Somewhat fluent). The response has grammatical errors present, which may cause some difficulty for the reader. Word choice is mostly appropriate, but some awkward phrasing or word repetition may exist.\n",
    "  2: (Somewhat inarticulate). The response has frequent grammatical errors make the writing difficult to understand. Sentence structure is often awkward, and there's little sense of flow.\n",
    "  1: (Inarticulate). The response is riddled with grammatical issues, rendering it incomprehensible in parts. Word choices may be very limited or inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "  STEP 1: Assess grammar correctness: Identify any specific errors in the response's sentence structure, verb usage, subject-verb agreement, punctuation, and capitalization.\n",
    "  STEP 2: Assess word choice and flow: Examine the response's sentence structure and how the writing moves from one idea to the next. Are words accurate and well-suited to the context?\n",
    "  STEP 3: Assess overall cohesion: Does the entire response read logically and smoothly, with appropriate transitions?\n",
